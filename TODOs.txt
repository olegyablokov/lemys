	BUGS:
fix 'help -' command bug;
sometimes (?) 'f -p' doesn't work (throws error: no previous word defined);
fix a misspelling in -remc (help -cb) subcommand description;
recent words box sometimes not working (goes into infinite cycle);

	NEW FEATURES:
add '-p' parameter to '-' command;
add '-n' parameter to 'f' and 'uf' commands (to refer the corresponding word by its index);
change '-' command name (it is rather clumsy);
add memento support (e.g. restoring with a state.json document after a failure);
add support for bug reports (maybe send them to Github's Issues?);
